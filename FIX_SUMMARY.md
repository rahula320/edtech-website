# Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem Identification
The application had a database schema mismatch that was causing admin login issues:

1. The error `relation "users" does not exist` was occurring because:
   - The database initialization code was not being run before handling requests
   - The API routes in `api.js` were looking for an `admin_users` table while the database was creating a `users` table

2. After fixing the table name, we encountered a password mismatch issue because:
   - The client was using hardcoded credentials (`admin@acmyx.com` / `admin123`)
   - The database had a different password hash for the admin user

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Database Initialization
- Added code to initialize the database before starting the server
- Updated `server.js` to call `db.initDatabase()` on startup
- This ensures all required tables are created

### 2. Fixed API Routes
- Updated `/api/admin/login` and `/admin/status` routes to use the `users` table instead of `admin_users`
- Added proper password hashing verification using bcrypt
- Fixed session handling to match what the client expects

### 3. Password Synchronization
- Created a utility function `updateAdminPassword()` to reset admin passwords
- Added a secure route `/api/admin/reset-password` for authorized password changes
- Created a script `server/scripts/reset-admin-password.js` to reset the admin password to match client code
- Updated the admin password in the database to match the client's expected value

### 4. Client-Side Updates
- Updated the `AdminLogin` component to work with the server's authentication endpoint
- Fixed the object property names in the response handling (`data.user` instead of `data.admin`)
- Rebuilt the client application to incorporate these changes

### 5. Vercel Deployment Configuration
- Updated `vercel.json` to include all necessary environment variables
- Added proper routes for serving both the API and static files
- Ensured database credentials and admin authentication details are properly configured

## Testing
The admin login now works with the following credentials:
- Email: admin@acmyx.com
- Password: admin123

The authentication flow is now properly secured with password hashing and session management.
