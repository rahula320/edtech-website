# Instructions for setting up your .env file

1. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project
2. Copy and paste the following content:

```
# Server Configuration
PORT=5001
NODE_ENV=development

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_OSsZKqm1iTV3@ep-floral-silence-a18kxybn-pooler.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require

# Admin Configuration
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@acmyx.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123

# Security
SESSION_SECRET=acmyx-education-platform-secret-key

# Email Configuration (optional)
# EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
# EMAIL_PASS=your_email_app_password
```

3. Save the file
4. Restart your server application

## Important Notes:
- The ADMIN_EMAIL and ADMIN_PASSWORD values should match what you're using in the login form
- The current error suggests that your server isn't recognizing these environment variables
- After creating the .env file, you need to restart your server for the changes to take effect
