This is a full-stack application for an educational technology platform, split into client and server components for easier development and deployment.

## üöÄ Features

- Modern and responsive design
- Interactive UI elements
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Contact form with validation
- Parallax effects
- User authentication system
- Course browsing and management
- RESTful API architecture

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

- **`/client`**: React frontend application
- **`/server`**: Express backend API server

This separation makes it easier to deploy the application to various hosting platforms that might have different requirements for frontend and backend hosting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rk2319/edtech-website.git
   cd edtech-website
   ```

2. **Run the clean installation script:**
   ```bash
   ./clean-install.sh
   ```

3. **Setup the server:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   cp .env.example .env  # Create and configure your .env file
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Setup the client:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

During development:
- The backend server runs on port 5001
- The frontend development server runs on port 3000
- The client proxies API requests to the backend

## üöÄ Production Deployment Options

### Option 1: Unified Deployment

Deploy both frontend and backend to a single server:

1. Build the client:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run build
   ```

2. Start the server in production mode:
   ```bash
   cd server
   NODE_ENV=production npm start
   ```

The server will serve the static client files and handle API requests.

### Option 2: Separate Deployments

Deploy the client and server independently:

1. **Client:** Deploy the built React app to a static hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run build
   # Deploy the build folder to your chosen provider
   ```

2. **Server:** Deploy the Node.js server to a service like Heroku, Railway, or Digital Ocean.
   ```bash
   cd server
   # Deploy to your chosen provider
   ```

   Make sure to update the client's API endpoints to point to your deployed server URL.

### Option 3: Docker Deployment

For containerized deployment:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

### Server Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the server directory:

```
PORT=5001
NODE_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@hostname/database?sslmode=require
SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-key-change-this-in-production
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-specific-password
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
```

### Client Environment Variables (if needed for separate deployment)

Create a `.env` file in the client directory for production build configuration:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-api-server-url.com
```

## üíª Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, React Router, CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** Neon PostgreSQL
- **Authentication:** Passport.js, bcrypt
- **Email:** Nodemailer
- **Icons:** Font Awesome
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
- **Deployment:** Shell scripts for automation

## Deployment to Vercel

### Prerequisites
- A Vercel account
- Vercel CLI installed (`npm install -g vercel`)
- Neon PostgreSQL account with project setup

### Automatic Deployment
1. Run the deployment script:
   ```
   npm run deploy
   ```
   
2. Follow the prompts from the Vercel CLI.

3. When deployment is complete, your application will be available at the provided Vercel URL.

### Manual Deployment
If you prefer to deploy manually:

1. Login to Vercel:
   ```
   vercel login
   ```

2. Deploy the application:
   ```
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. Configure environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:
   - `DATABASE_URL`: Your Neon PostgreSQL connection string
   - `SESSION_SECRET`: A secure random string
   - `ADMIN_EMAIL`: Email for admin access
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Password for admin access

### Admin Access
Once deployed, you can access the admin panel at:
```
https://[your-vercel-domain]/admin
```

Login with the credentials configured in your environment variables.

## Development

### Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm run install-all
   ```

2. Start development servers:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Project Structure
- `/client` - React frontend
- `/server` - Express backend
- `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration

# Security Update: Removing Hardcoded Credentials

In a recent security update, all hardcoded admin credentials and database connection details have been removed from the codebase. These credentials are now managed through environment variables, which enhances the security of the application.

## Key Changes

1. **Admin Authentication**: Admin credentials are now stored as environment variables instead of being hardcoded in the codebase.
2. **Database Connection**: Database connection strings have been removed from the codebase and are now expected to be provided via environment variables.
3. **Client-Side Authentication**: The client now properly communicates with the server API for authentication instead of using hardcoded values.

## Setting Up Environment Variables

See the `ENV_SETUP.md` file for detailed instructions on setting up the required environment variables for both local development and deployment.

## Required Environment Variables

The following environment variables are now required:

- `DATABASE_URL`: The PostgreSQL connection string
- `ADMIN_EMAIL`: The email address for admin login
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: The password for admin login

Please refer to the `ENV_SETUP.md` file for more detailed information.
